This assignment has us create an application that can be used to organize your burgers to what you have eaten and what you have yet to devou while also adding new burgers to devour. This application uses a Node & Express backend to save and retrieve burger data from a mySQL database file.

As specified in the assignment, a user can add new burgers through a textbox and button. They can also devour uneaten burgers or they can delete burgers from the list. Now go enjoy those burgers!
